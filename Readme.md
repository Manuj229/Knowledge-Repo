## Introduction

Here I write about current affairs in my own terms. This is just a knowledge repository, but also include moderate opinions. I have done a classification of news based on my initial understanding, will keep on adding the topics and issues. Will try to keep on writing answers and updating the content based on PYQs and recent developments in India.

## Approach

1. Read the news.
2. Understand the key terminologies.
3. If topic is not known, read something about the topic.
4. Write the topic in 4 bullet points. Not more then 250 words.

## How to write a topic?

I am an unorganised person. I don’t have a flow in writing as of now. So how do I even write something of my own? Here is a generic approach to write any topic:

1. Write the Date of the news in h2 format.
2. Write the most crunchy line of the article / news / GPT.
3. Use GPT to summarise, if you can’t.
4. Try to structure the topic in 4 bullet points in this fashion:
    1. Intro (40-45 words)
    2. Problem / Concern / Current situation ( 80 words)
    3. Solutions / Approaches (80 words)
    4. Conclusions / important lines. ( 45 words).
5. Sometimes it won’t be possible to write in this order. Please follow your heart at discretion.

## How do I even know I have added something to this repository?

For this I have thought to make a change log. Change log would be a simple excel sheet.
