Q: Discuss the link between malnutrition and child mortality in India, and assess the progress made in reducing these deaths over the past few decades.

Answer:
**Introduction**  
In 2021, 0.7 million children under the age of five died in India, with over 70% of these deaths linked to malnutrition. This stark figure highlights the severe impact of child and maternal malnutrition on mortality rates.

**Key Points:**

1. **Malnutrition as a Key Factor**: Of the 0.7 million child deaths in India, 0.5 million were attributed to malnutrition, primarily due to low birth weight, wasting, and stunting. Malnutrition weakens children's immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infections.
    
2. **Global Comparison**: Indiaâ€™s malnutrition-related death rate is higher than the global average, with malnutrition contributing to 50% of child deaths worldwide, compared to 70% in India.
    
3. **Economic Correlation**: Malnutrition deaths are concentrated in low-income countries, where inadequate diets and higher disease prevalence exacerbate child mortality.
    
4. **Progress in Reducing Deaths**: Since 1990, India has seen an 80% reduction in malnutrition-related child deaths due to improvements in nutrition, healthcare, sanitation, and vaccination programs.
    

**Conclusion**  
While India has made significant progress, sustained efforts to improve maternal and child nutrition, along with addressing poverty and disease, remain crucial to achieving further reductions in child mortality.
